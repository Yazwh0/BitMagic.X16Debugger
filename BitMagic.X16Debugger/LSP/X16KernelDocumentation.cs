The data is returned in the accumulator.  Errors are returned in the status word which can be read via the \\u0060READST\\u0060 API call.\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"MACPTR\":\"**MACPTR**\\r\\n\\r\\nPurpose: Read multiple bytes from the peripheral bus  \\r\\nCall address: $FF44  \\r\\nCommunication registers: .A .X .Y c  \\r\\nPreparatory routines: \\u0060SETNAM\\u0060, \\u0060SETLFS\\u0060, \\u0060OPEN\\u0060, \\u0060CHKIN\\u0060  \\r\\nError returns: None  \\r\\nRegisters affected: .A .X .Y  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Description:** The routine \\u0060MACPTR\\u0060 is the multi-byte variant of the \\u0060ACPTR\\u0060 KERNAL routine. Instead of returning a single byte in .A, it can read multiple bytes in one call and write them directly to memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of bytes to be read is passed in the .A register; a value of 0 indicates that it is up to the KERNAL to decide how many bytes to read - up to a maximum of 512 bytes (this corresponds to 1 sector on the SD card). A pointer to where the data is supposed to be written is passed in the .X (lo) and .Y (hi) registers. If carry flag is clear, the destination address will advance with each byte read. If the carry flag is set, the destination address will not advance as data is read. This is useful for reading data directly into VRAM, PCM FIFO, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor reading into Hi RAM, you must set the desired bank prior to calling \\u0060MACPTR\\u0060. During the read, \\u0060MACPTR\\u0060 will automatically wrap to the next bank as required, leaving the new bank active when finished.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon return, a set c flag indicates that the device or file does not support \\u0060MACPTR\\u0060, and the program needs to read the data byte-by-byte using the \\u0060ACPTR\\u0060 call instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf \\u0060MACPTR\\u0060 is supported, c is clear and .X (lo) and .Y (hi) contain the number of bytes read.\\r\\n*It is possible that this is less than the number of bytes requested to be read! (But is always greater than 0)*\\r\\n\\r\\nLike with \\u0060ACPTR\\u0060, the status of the operation can be retrieved using the \\u0060READST\\u0060 KERNAL call.\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"MCIOUT\":\"**MCIOUT**\\r\\n\\r\\nPurpose: Write multiple bytes to the peripheral bus  \\r\\nCall address: $FEB1  \\r\\nCommunication registers: .A .X .Y c  \\r\\nPreparatory routines: \\u0060SETNAM\\u0060, \\u0060SETLFS\\u0060, \\u0060OPEN\\u0060, \\u0060CHKOUT\\u0060  \\r\\nError returns: None  \\r\\nRegisters affected: .A .X .Y  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Description:** The routine \\u0060MCIOUT\\u0060 is the multi-byte variant of the \\u0060CIOUT\\u0060 KERNAL routine. Instead of writing a single byte, it can write multiple bytes from memory in one call.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of bytes to be written is passed in the .A register; a value of 0 indicates 256 bytes. A pointer to the data to be read from is passed in the .X (lo) and .Y (hi) registers. If carry flag is clear, the source address will advance with each byte read out. If the carry flag is set, the source address will not advance as data is read out. This is useful for saving data directly from VRAM.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor reading from Hi RAM, you must set the desired bank prior to calling \\u0060MCIOUT\\u0060. During the operation, \\u0060MCIOUT\\u0060 will automatically wrap to the next bank as required, leaving the new bank active when finished.\\r\\n\\r\\nUpon return, a set c flag indicates that the device or file does not support \\u0060MCIOUT\\u0060, and the program needs to write the data byte-by-byte using the \\u0060CIOUT\\u0060 call instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf \\u0060MCIOUT\\u0060 is supported, c is clear and .X (lo) and .Y (hi) contain the number of bytes written.\\r\\n*It is possible that this is less than the number of bytes requested to be written! (But is always greater than 0)*\\r\\n\\r\\nLike with \\u0060CIOUT\\u0060, the status of the operation can be retrieved using the \\u0060READST\\u0060 KERNAL call.  If an error occurred, \\u0060READST\\u0060 should return nonzero.\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"BSAVE\":\"**BSAVE**\\r\\n\\r\\nPurpose: Save an area of memory to a file without writing an address header.  \\r\\nCall Address: $FEBA  \\r\\nCommunication Registers: .A .X .Y  \\r\\nPreparatory routines: SETNAM, SETLFS  \\r\\nError returns: c = 0 if no error, c = 1 in case of error and A will contain kernel error code  \\r\\nRegisters affected: .A .X .Y .P  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Description:** Save the contents of a memory range to a file.  Unlike \\u0060SAVE\\u0060, this call does not write the start address to the beginning of the output file.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0060SETLFS\\u0060 and \\u0060SETNAM\\u0060 must be called beforehand.  \\r\\nA is address of zero page pointer to the start address.  \\r\\nX and Y contain the _exclusive_ end address to save. That is, these should contain the address immediately after the final byte:  X = low byte, Y = high byte.  \\r\\nUpon return, if C is clear, there were no errors.  C being set indicates an error in which case A will have the error number.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"BSOUT\":\"**BSOUT**\\r\\n\\r\\n(This routine is also referred to as \\u0060CHROUT\\u0060)  \\r\\n\\r\\nPurpose: Write a character to the default output device.  \\r\\nCall Address: $FFD2  \\r\\nCommunication Register: .A  \\r\\nPreparatory routines: OPEN, CHKOUT (Both are only needed when sending to files/other non-screen devices)  \\r\\nError returns: c = 0 if no error, c = 1 in case of error  \\r\\nRegisters affected: .P  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Description:** Writes the character in A to the currently-selected output device. By default, this is the user\\u0027s screen. By calling \\u0060CHKOUT\\u0060, however, the default device can be changed and characters can be sent to other devices - a file on an SD card, for example. In order to send output to a file, call \\u0060OPEN\\u0060 first to open the file, then \\u0060CHKOUT\\u0060 to set it as the default output device, then finally \\u0060BSOUT\\u0060 to write the data.  \\r\\n\\r\\nUpon return, if C is clear, there were no errors. Otherwise, C will be set.  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Note:** Before returning, this routine uses a \\u0060CLI\\u0060 processor instruction, which will allow IRQ interrupts to be triggered. This makes the \\u0060BSOUT\\u0060 routine inappropriate for use within interrupt handler functions. One possible workaround could be to output text information directly, by writing to the appropriate VERA registers. Care must be taken to save and restore the VERA\\u0027s state, however, in order to prevent affecting other software running on the system (to include BASIC or the KERNAL itself).  \\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"CLOSE\":\"**CLOSE**\\r\\n\\r\\nPurpose: Close a logical file  \\r\\nCall address: $FFC3  \\r\\nCommunication registers: .A  \\r\\nPreparatory routines: None  \\r\\nError returns: None  \\r\\nRegisters affected: .A .X .Y .P  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Description:** \\u0060CLOSE\\u0060 releases resources associated with a logical file number.  If the associated device is a serial device on the IEC bus or is a simulated serial device such as CMDR-DOS backed by the X16 SD card, and the file was opened with a secondary address, a close command is sent to the device or to CMDR-DOS.  \\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"CHKIN\":\"**CHKIN**\\r\\n\\r\\nPurpose: Set file to be used for character input  \\r\\nCall address: $FFC6  \\r\\nCommunication registers: .X  \\r\\nPreparatory routines: OPEN  \\r\\nError returns: None  \\r\\nRegisters affected: .A .X\\r\\n\\r\\n**Description:** \\u0060CHKIN\\u0060 sets a file to be used as default input allowing for\\r\\nsubsequent calls to \\u0060CHRIN\\u0060 or other file read functions. The \\u0060x\\u0060 register\\r\\nshould contain the logical file number. \\u0060OPEN\\u0060 will need to have been called prior to using \\u0060CHKIN\\u0060.\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"LOAD\":\"**LOAD**\\r\\n\\r\\nPurpose: Load the contents of a file from disk to memory  \\r\\nCall address: $FFD5  \\r\\nCommunication registers: .A .X .Y  \\r\\nPreparatory routines: SETNAM, SETLFS  \\r\\nError returns: Carry (Set on Error), .A  \\r\\nRegisters affected: .A .X .Y .P  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Description:** Loads a file from disk to memory.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe behavior of \\u0060LOAD\\u0060 can be modified by parameters passed to prior call to \\u0060SETLFS\\u0060.  In particular, the .Y register, which usually denotes the _secondary address_, has a specific meaning as follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n* .Y = 0: load to the address given in .X/.Y to the \\u0060LOAD\\u0060 call, skipping the first two bytes of the file. (like \\u0060LOAD \\u0022FILE\\u0022,8\\u0060 in BASIC)\\r\\n* .Y = 1: load to the address given by the first two bytes of the file. The address in .X/.Y is ignored. (like \\u0060LOAD \\u0022FILE\\u0022,8,1\\u0060 in BASIC)\\r\\n* .Y = 2: load the entire file to the address given in .X/.Y to the \\u0060LOAD\\u0060 call. This is also known as a _headerless_ load. (like \\u0060BLOAD \\u0022FILE\\u0022,8,1,$A000\\u0060 in BASIC)\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the \\u0060LOAD\\u0060 call itself, .X and .Y is the memory address to load\\r\\nthe file into. .A controls where the file is to be loaded. On the X16, \\u0060LOAD\\u0060 has an\\r\\nadditional feature to load the contents of a file directly into VRAM.\\r\\n\\r\\n* If the A register is zero, the kernal loads into system memory.\\r\\n* If the A register is 1, the kernal performs a verify.\\r\\n* If the A register is 2, the kernal loads into VRAM, starting from $00000 \\u002B the specified starting address.\\r\\n* If the A register is 3, the kernal loads into VRAM, starting from $10000 \\u002B the specified starting address.\\r\\n\\r\\n(On the C64, if A is greater than or equal to 1, the kernal performs a verify)\\r\\n\\r\\nFor loads into the banked RAM area. The current RAM bank (in location \\u0060$00\\u0060) is used as the start point for the load along with the supplied address. If the load is large enough to advance to the end of banked RAM (\\u0060$BFFF\\u0060), the RAM bank is automatically advanced, and the load continues into the next bank starting at \\u0060$A000\\u0060.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter the load, if c is set, an error occurred and .A will contain the error code. If c is clear, .X/.Y will point to the address of final byte loaded \\u002B 1.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: One does not need to call \\u0060CLOSE\\u0060 after \\u0060LOAD\\u0060.\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"OPEN\":\"**OPEN**\\r\\n\\r\\nPurpose: Opens a channel/file  \\r\\nCall address: $FFC0  \\r\\nCommunication registers: None  \\r\\nPreparatory routines: SETNAM, SETLFS  \\r\\nError returns: None  \\r\\nRegisters affected: .A .X .Y  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Description:** Opens a file or channel.  \\r\\nThe most common pattern is to then redirect the standard input or output to the file using \\u0060CHKIN\\u0060 or \\u0060CHKOUT\\u0060 respectively. Afterwards, I/O from or to the file or channel is done using \\u0060BASIN\\u0060 (\\u0060CHRIN\\u0060) and \\u0060BSOUT\\u0060 (\\u0060CHROUT\\u0060) respectively.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor file I/O, the lower level calls \\u0060ACPTR\\u0060 and \\u0060MACPTR\\u0060 can be used in place of \\u0060CHRIN\\u0060, since \\u0060CHKIN\\u0060 does the low-level setup for this.  Likewise \\u0060CIOUT\\u0060 and \\u0060MCIOUT\\u0060 can be used after \\u0060CHKOUT\\u0060 for the same reason.\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"SAVE\":\"**SAVE**\\r\\n\\r\\nPurpose: Save an area of memory to a file.  \\r\\nCall Address: $FFD8  \\r\\nCommunication Registers: .A .X .Y  \\r\\nPreparatory routines: SETNAM, SETLFS  \\r\\nError returns: c = 0 if no error, c = 1 in case of error and A will contain kernel error code  \\r\\nRegisters affected: .A .X .Y .P  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Description:** Save the contents of a memory range to a file. The (little-endian) start address is written to the file as the first two bytes of output, followed by the requested data.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0060SETLFS\\u0060 and \\u0060SETNAM\\u0060 must be called beforehand.  \\r\\nA is address of zero page pointer to start address.  \\r\\nX = low byte of end address \\u002B 1, Y = high byte of end address.  \\r\\nIf C is zero there were no errors; 1 is an error in which case A will have the error  \\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"SETLFS\":\"**SETLFS**\\r\\n\\r\\nPurpose: Set file parameters  \\r\\nCall Address: $FFBA  \\r\\nCommunication Registers: .A .X .Y  \\r\\nPreparatory routines: SETNAM  \\r\\nError returns: None  \\r\\nRegisters affected: .A .X .Y  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Description:** Set file parameters typically after calling SETNAM\\r\\n\\r\\nA is the logical file number, X is the device number, and Y is the secondary address.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince multiple files can be open (with some exceptions), the value of A specifies the file\\r\\nnumber. If only one file is being opened at a time, $01 can be used.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe device number corresponds to the hardware device where the file lives. On the X16,\\r\\n$08 would be the SD card.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe secondary address has some special meanings:  \\r\\n\\r\\nWhen used with \\u0060OPEN\\u0060 on disk type devices, the following applies:  \\r\\n\\r\\n* 0 = Load (open for read)\\r\\n* 1 = Save (open for write)\\r\\n* 2-14 = Read mode, by default. Write, Append, and Modify modes can be specified in the SETNAM filename string as the third argument, e.g. \\u0060\\u0022FILE.DAT,S,W\\u0022\\u0060 for write mode. The seek command \\u0022P\\u0022 is available in any mode.\\r\\n* 15 = Command Channel (for sending special commands to CMDR-DOS or the disk device)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen used with \\u0060LOAD\\u0060 the following applies:\\r\\n\\r\\n* 0 = Load the data to address specified in the X and Y register of the LOAD call, regardless of the address header. The two-byte header itself is not loaded into RAM.\\r\\n* 1 = Load to the address specified in the file\\u0027s header. The two-byte header itself is not loaded into RAM.\\r\\n* 2 = Load the data to address specified in the X and Y register of the LOAD call. The entire file is loaded (\\u0022headerless\\u0022).\\r\\n\\r\\nFor more information see [Chapter 13: Working with CMDR-DOS](X16%20Reference%20-%2013%20-%20Working%20with%20CMDR-DOS.md#chapter-13-working-with-cmdr-dos)\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"SETNAM\":\"**SETNAM**\\r\\n\\r\\nPurpose: Set file name  \\r\\nCall Address: $FFBD  \\r\\nCommunication Registers: .A .X .Y  \\r\\nPreparatory routines: SETLFS  \\r\\nError returns: None  \\r\\nRegisters affected: .A .X .Y  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Description:** Inform the kernal the name of the file that is to later be opened.\\r\\n A is filename length, X is low byte of filename pointer, Y is high byte of filename pointer.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0060\\u0060\\u0060asm\\r\\n  lda #$08\\r\\n  ldx #\\u003Cfilename\\r\\n  ldy #\\u003Efilename\\r\\n  jsr SETNAM\\r\\n\\u0060\\u0060\\u0060\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0060SETLFS\\u0060 and \\u0060SETNAM\\u0060 both need to be called prior other file comamnds, such as \\u0060OPEN\\u0060 or\\r\\n\\u0060SAVE\\u0060.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo append to a file, add \\u0060,?,A\\u0060 to the filename. See [Appending to file](X16%20Reference%20-%2013%20-%20Working%20with%20CMDR-DOS.md#appending-to-file).\\r\\n\\r\\n**Warning:** Appending to file involves a risk of corrupting the file system of the SD card!

This is useful for filling VERA memory (\\\\$9F23 or \\\\$9F24), for example.\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"memory_copy\":\"**memory_copy**\\r\\n\\r\\nSignature: void memory_copy(word source: r0, word target: r1, word num_bytes: r2);  \\r\\nPurpose: Copy a memory region to a different region.  \\r\\nCall address: $FEE7\\r\\n\\r\\n**Description:** This function copies one memory region specified by an address (r0) and a size in bytes (r2) to a different region specified by its start address (r1). The two regions may overlap. r0 and r1 are preserved, r2 is destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike with \\u0060memory_fill\\u0060, source and destination addresses in the \\\\$9F00-\\\\$9FFF range will not be incremented during the copy. This allows, for instance, uploading data from RAM to VERA (destination of \\\\$9F23 or \\\\$9F24), downloading data from VERA (source \\\\$9F23 or \\\\$9F24) or copying data inside VERA (source \\\\$9F23, destination \\\\$9F24). This functionality can also be used to upload, download or transfer data with other I/O devices that have an 8 bit data port.\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"memory_crc\":\"**memory_crc**\\r\\n\\r\\nSignature: (word result: r2) memory_crc(word address: r0, word num_bytes: r1);  \\r\\nPurpose: Calculate the CRC16 of a memory region.  \\r\\nCall address: $FEEA\\r\\n\\r\\n**Description:** This function calculates the CRC16 checksum ([CRC-16/IBM-3740](https://www.crccalc.com/?crc=01%2002%2003%2004\\u0026method=CRC-16/IBM-3740\\u0026datatype=hex\\u0026outtype=hex)) of the memory region specified by an address (r0) and a size in bytes (r1). The result is returned in r2. r0 is preserved, r1 is destroyed.\\r\\n\\r\\nLike \\u0060memory_fill\\u0060, this function does not increment the address if it is in the range of \\\\$9F00-\\\\$9FFF, which allows checksumming VERA memory or data streamed from any other I/O device.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: ROM R48 and older contains the following bug: If the size of the data is not a multiple of 256, the remainder of the data is processed in the wrong byte order. This bug was fixed in [#382](https://github.com/X16Community/x16-rom/pull/382). Thus, if your data is not a multiple of 256, you will get different CRC depending of ROM version.\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"memory_decompress\":\"**memory_decompress**\\r\\n\\r\\nSignature: void memory_decompress(word input: r0, inout word output: r1);  \\r\\nPurpose: Decompress an LZSA2 block  \\r\\nCall address: $FEED\\r\\n\\r\\n**Description:** This function decompresses an LZSA2-compressed data block from the location passed in r0 and outputs the decompressed data at the location passed in r1. After the call, r1 will be updated with the location of the last output byte plus one.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the target address is in the \\\\$9F00-\\\\$9FFF range, all bytes will be written to the same address (r0), i.e. the address will not be incremented. This is useful for decompressing directly into VERA memory (\\\\$9F23 or \\\\$9F24), for example. Note that decompressing _from_ I/O is not supported.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Notes**:\\r\\n\\r\\n* To create compressed data, use the \\u0060lzsa\\u0060 tool[^1] like this:\\r\\n\\u0060lzsa -r -f2 \\u003Coriginal_file\\u003E \\u003Ccompressed_file\\u003E\\u0060\\r\\n* If using the LZSA library to compress data, make sure to use format 2 and include the raw blocks flag, which is what the above command does.\\r\\n* This function cannot be used to decompress data in-place, as the output data would overwrite the input data before it is consumed. Therefore, make sure to load the input data to a different location.\\r\\n* It is possible to have the input data stored in banked RAM, with the obvious 8 KB size restriction.\\r\\n* When decompressing to VRAM, it\\u0027s reccomended to do that through \\u0060DATA0\\u0060.\\r\\n* If you\\u0027d like to have control of how the LZSA2 data is obtained, check out the [\\u0060memory_decompress_from_func\\u0060](#extapi-function-name-memory_decompress_from_func) function.\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"fetch\":\"**fetch**\\r\\n\\r\\nPurpose: Read a byte from any RAM or ROM bank  \\r\\nCall address: $FF74  \\r\\nCommunication registers: .A .X .Y .P  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Description:** This function performs an \\u0060LDA (ZP),Y\\u0060 from any RAM or ROM bank.

The Carry\\r\\nflag is bit 0, so setting $30F to 1 before calling MEMTOP indicates that this is\\r\\na _read_ of the values. \\r\\n\\r\\n1. Line 10 reads the current values. Do this to preserve the extended RAM bank\\r\\n   count.\\r\\n2. Line 20 uses the X and Y variables to make the code easier to read.

The c flag specifies whether text should be wrapped at character (c=0) or word (c=1) boundaries. In the latter case, characters will be buffered until a SPACE, CR or LF character is sent, so make sure the text that is printed always ends in one of these characters.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Note**: If the bottom of the screen is reached, this function will scroll its contents up to make extra room.\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"console_put_image\":\"**console_put_image**\\r\\n\\r\\nSignature: void console_put_image(word ptr: r0, word width: r1, word height: r2);  \\r\\nPurpose: Draw image as if it was a character.  \\r\\nCall address: $FED8\\r\\n\\r\\n**Description:** This function draws an image (in GRAPH_draw_image format) at the current cursor position and advances the cursor accordingly. This way, an image can be presented inline. A common example would be an emoji bitmap, but it is also possible to show full-width pictures if you print a newline before and after the image.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Notes**:\\r\\n\\r\\n* If the bottom of the screen is reached, this function will scroll its contents up to make extra room.\\r\\n* Subsequent line breaks will take the image height into account, so that the new cursor position is below the image.\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"console_get_char\":\"**console_get_char**\\r\\n\\r\\nSignature: (byte char: .A) console_get_char();  \\r\\nPurpose: Get a character from the console.  \\r\\nCall address: $FEE1\\r\\n\\r\\n**Description:** This function gets a character to the console. It does this by collecting a whole line of character, i.e. until the user presses RETURN. Then, the line will be sent character by character.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis function allows editing the line using BACKSPACE/DEL, but does not allow moving the cursor within the line, write more than one line, or using control codes.\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"console_set_paging_message\":\"**console_set_paging_message**\\r\\n\\r\\nSignature: void console_set_paging_message(word message: r0);  \\r\\nPurpose: Set the paging message or disable paging.  \\r\\nCall address: $FED5\\r\\n\\r\\n**Description:** The console can halt printing after a full screen height worth of text has been printed. It will then show a message, wait for any key, and continue printing. This function sets this message. A zero-terminated text is passed in r0. To turn off paging, call this function with r0 = 0 - this is the default.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Note:** It is possible to use control codes to change the text style and color. Do not use codes that change the cursor position, like CR or LF. Also, the text must not overflow one line on the screen.\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"enter_basic\":\"**enter_basic**\\r\\n\\r\\nPurpose: Enter BASIC  \\r\\nCall address: $FF47  \\r\\nCommunication registers: .P  \\r\\nPreparatory routines: None  \\r\\nError returns: Does not return  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Description:** Call this to enter BASIC mode, either through a cold start (c=1) or a warm start (c=0).\\r\\n\\r\\n**EXAMPLE:**\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0060\\u0060\\u0060ASM\\r\\nCLC\\r\\nJMP enter_basic ; returns to the \\u0022READY.\\u0022 prompt\\r\\n\\u0060\\u0060\\u0060\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"entropy_get\":\"**entropy_get**\\r\\n\\r\\nPurpose: Get 24 random bits  \\r\\nCall address: $FECF  \\r\\nCommunication registers: .A .X .Y  \\r\\nPreparatory routines: None  \\r\\nError returns: None  \\r\\nRegisters affected: .A .X .Y  \\r\\n\\r\\n**Description:** This routine returns 24 somewhat random bits in registers .A, .X, and .Y.

The column count is returned in .X and the row count is returned in .Y.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn contrast to calling [\\u0060screen_mode\\u0060](#function-name-screen_mode) with carry set, this function returns the configured resolution if ever it is updated by [\\u0060scnsiz\\u0060](#extapi-function-name-scnsiz). \\u0060screen_mode\\u0060 only returns the text dimensions the currently configured mode would have configured, ignoring any changes made by calls to \\u0060scnsiz\\u0060.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n**EXAMPLE:**\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0060\\u0060\\u0060ASM\\r\\nSCREEN = $FFED\\r\\n\\r\\nget_res:\\r\\n        jsr SCREEN\\r\\n        sty my_rows\\r\\n        stx my_columns\\r\\n        rts\\r\\n\\u0060\\u0060\\u0060\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"screen_mode\":\"**screen_mode**\\r\\n\\r\\nPurpose: Get/Set the screen mode  \\r\\nCall address: $FF5F  \\r\\nCommunication registers: .A, .X, .Y, .P  \\r\\nPreparatory routines: None  \\r\\nError returns: c = 1 in case of error  \\r\\nRegisters affected: .A, .X, .Y\\r\\n\\r\\n**Description:** If c is set, a call to this routine gets the current screen mode in .A, the width (in tiles) of the screen in .X, and the height (in tiles) of the screen in .Y. If c is clear, it sets the current screen mode to the value in .A. \\r\\nFor a list of possible values, see [Chapter 3: Editor](X16%20Reference%20-%2003%20-%20Editor.md#modes). If the mode is unsupported, c will be set, otherwise cleared.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you use this function to get the text resolution instead of calling [\\u0060SCREEN\\u0060](#function-name-screen), this function only returns the text dimensions the currently configured mode would have set, ignoring any changes made by calls to [\\u0060scnsiz\\u0060](#extapi-function-name-scnsiz). If you want to fetch the KERNAL editor\\u0027s text resolution, call [\\u0060SCREEN\\u0060](#function-name-screen) instead.\\r\\n\\r\\n**EXAMPLE:**\\r\\n\\r\\n\\u0060\\u0060\\u0060ASM\\r\\nLDA #$80\\r\\nCLC\\r\\nJSR screen_mode ; SET 320x240@256C MODE\\r\\nBCS FAILURE\\r\\n\\u0060\\u0060\\u0060\\r\\n\\r\\n\",\"screen_set_charset\":\"**screen_set_charset**\\r\\n\\r\\nPurpose: Activate a 8x8 text mode charset  \\r\\nCall address: $FF62\\r\\n\\r\\nCommunication registers: .A, .X, .Y  \\r\\nPreparatory routines: None  \\r\\nRegisters affected: .A, .X, .Y\\r\\n\\r\\n**Description:** A call to this routine uploads a character set to the video hardware and activates it.
